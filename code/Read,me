This directory is the new home of the code, starting with release 0.4. There are two directories, platform and IP400. The platform directory contains the CubeIDE project and
IOC file (everything needed to build the hardware specific code), for different platforms. These directories may not contain the latest code. Copy the contents of the IP400
directories into the platform directory and then compile.

The current source code is at Rev level 0.4a, the older code has been removed.

As of this rev, the supported platforms are:
Nucleo CC2 board.
Pi Zero HAT with discrete WL33 radio (400 MHz version only). Coming soon.

Release notes are in the appropriate directory.
